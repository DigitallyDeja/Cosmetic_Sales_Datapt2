# Cosmetic_Sales_Datapt2
This project explores a new set of KPIs that could be answered from the <a href="https://github.com/DigitallyDeja/Cosmetic_Sales_Data">Cosmetic_Sales_Data</a>. The data was cleaned in SQL and visualized in Tableau.

## Dataset used 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/cosmetics-and-skincare-product-sales-data-2022">Cosmetic Sales Dataset</a>

## Questions KPIs
### Summary KPI 
- What are the total profits in sales?

### Core KPIs
- What country contributed to the highest average revenue?
- Which three countries had the largest amount of sales in each quarter and how does the amount of sales differ as time progresses?
- Which products preformed the best in each country?
- Which month peaked for the total amount of shipments sold?

## Project Insights
- The USA has sold $8380 in sales, which is the highest average amount of products sold

- The USA leads with $ 271,000 in Q2, followed by Australia at $ 260,000 and New Zealand at $ 228,000. Following this peak, there is a consistent decline in sales in Q3, with a drop of approximately 60-70% compared to Q2 for these countries.

- The anti-aging product sold the most across all countries, with the highest sales volume coming from the USA, about $114,000. The following is the body butter, from which the largest volume of sales comes from New Zealand, at about $87,000.

- In March 2022, the total amount of boxes sold reached its peak at $15,167, following a decline in shipment sales from $6,963 in February.

## Project Takeaway

This analysis highlights how sales performance varies across countries, products, and time. The USA consistently leads in revenue, particularly in Q2, where sales reached their peak before experiencing a significant decline in subsequent quarters. Product trends reveal that anti-aging items dominate the global market, with body butter showing strong regional performance in New Zealand. Seasonal trends are also evident, as March 2022 marked the highest shipment volume, reflecting potential demand cycles within the cosmetic industry.

Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of monitoring quarterly performance, product-specific demand, and seasonal peaks. Businesses could use these insights to adjust marketing strategies, optimize inventory, and target high-performing regions and product categories more effectively.
